This is my first post for LIS4370

Task #2 Set Up a Blog

Task #3 Install R and RStudio

![](rstudio_console.png)

The installation process of RStudio required me to install R first because
RStudio relies on the R programming language for its functionality. The process
began with going to the R project website to download the file for my operating
system, and then run the installer. Once it was installed, I was able to go to
the website that allowed me to download the desktop installer for RStudio.

The main issue I encountered during installation was that it was difficult to
have the right Windows installer to be able to download it successfully. This
problem is what caused me to install RStudio repetitively. The way I resolved
this problem is that I got the right runtime application that supports the
installation requirements for RStudio. 

In terms of my system details, I ran a Windows 11 operating system on my PC, the
R version that I currently have is R 4.4.2, and RStudio version is 2024.12.0.467.

Task #4 Read Foundational Chapters

An R vector is an object or entity that acts as a container to store data. The
vector is the simplest way to store more than one data value in R programs.
Vectors are important for data analysis because they can hold different data
types or modes in one container. After storing data types in the container, R
programs and applications can iterate over the elements in the vector and
perform many different types of operations on the different modes or types of
data contained in the vector for further analysis and extracting meaning out of
large data sets. Elements in vectors can be modified and updated, which makes
them flexible and versatile, so if data changes, a vector is a good way to keep
track of variables.
